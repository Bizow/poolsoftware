###### Harrys Notes

1.  Filter Dropdown needs to have additional options (i.e. Contains, Greater Than, Less Than, etc)
2.  Ability to select what what columns you want to include in the report (right now it shows all)
3.  the '+' sign should allow you to add another filter into your 'report', currently it saves the report
4.  Wire up the 'save report' button
5.  Add 'report name' field when saving a report (maybe ability to share with users?)
6.  Handling of Array Columns
